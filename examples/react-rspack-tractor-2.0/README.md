# Tractor 2.0 + Rspack + MF + Zephyr Sample


A micro frontends sample implementation of [The Tractor Store](https://micro-frontends.org/tractor-store/) built with Module Federation and React. It's based on the [Piral version](https://github.com/piral-samples/tractor-v2).

### Limitations

This implementation is deliberately kept simple to focus on the micro frontends aspects. URLs are hardcoded, components could be more DRY and no linting, testing or type-safety is implemented. In a real-world scenario, these aspects should be addressed properly.

### Performance

Several performance optimizations could still be applied, however, in the out-of-the-box state with three micro frontends and multiple components / pages included we'll end up with a lighthouse score of 100/100, which is great.

## How to run locally

### Installation

**Fork** this repository. Then use `pnpm` to bootstrap the mono repo. Make sure to have `pnpm` (v9) installed for this.

Run the following command inside the repository:

```sh
pnpm install
```

### Running the Code

1. Build the `explore` app first 

Because this project has recursive dependencies, you must comment out remotes that's yet build, and build the remotes first -- otherwise Zephyr won't be able to map your remotes against your host applications (or the application consumes it).

Note that each `build` command will trigger a deployment with Zephyr. 

In the [rspack.config.ts of `explore`](./apps/explore/rspack.config.js), comment out the remotes (it's not built yet):

```ts
 new ModuleFederationPlugin({
      name,
      filename: 'remoteEntry.js',
      shared: ['react', 'react-dom', 'react-router', 'react-router-dom'],
      // remotes: {
      //   tractor_v2_checkout: 'tractor_v2_checkout@http://localhost:3001/remoteEntry.js',
      // },
      exposes: {
        './HomePage': path.resolve(__dirname) + '/src/HomePage.tsx',
        './CategoryPage': path.resolve(__dirname) + '/src/CategoryPage.tsx',
        './StoresPage': path.resolve(__dirname) + '/src/StoresPage.tsx',
        './Recommendations': path.resolve(__dirname) + '/src/Recommendations.tsx',
        './StorePicker': path.resolve(__dirname) + '/src/StorePicker.tsx',
        './Header': path.resolve(__dirname) + '/src/Header.tsx',
        './Footer': path.resolve(__dirname) + '/src/Footer.tsx',
      },
    }),
```

and run 

```
WITH_ZE=true pnpm --filter tractor_v2_explore run build
```

2. Build `checkout` app 

At this point `explore` app has been build and `checkout` app is only consuming `explore`, we build the `checkout` app next: 

```sh 
WITH_ZE=true pnpm --filter tractor_v2_checkout run build
```

3. Uncomment `checkout` in `explore` app 

Run explore app's build again to build it to a full app, but uncomment the remotes in configuration file: 

```ts

new ModuleFederationPlugin({
      name,
      filename: 'remoteEntry.js',
      shared: ['react', 'react-dom', 'react-router', 'react-router-dom'],
       remotes: {
         tractor_v2_checkout: 'tractor_v2_checkout@http://localhost:3001/remoteEntry.js',
       },
      exposes: {
        './HomePage': path.resolve(__dirname) + '/src/HomePage.tsx',
        './CategoryPage': path.resolve(__dirname) + '/src/CategoryPage.tsx',
        './StoresPage': path.resolve(__dirname) + '/src/StoresPage.tsx',
        './Recommendations': path.resolve(__dirname) + '/src/Recommendations.tsx',
        './StorePicker': path.resolve(__dirname) + '/src/StorePicker.tsx',
        './Header': path.resolve(__dirname) + '/src/Header.tsx',
        './Footer': path.resolve(__dirname) + '/src/Footer.tsx',
      },
    }),
```

```sh 
WITH_ZE=true pnpm --filter tractor_v2_explore run build
```

4. Build `decide` 

Since `explore` and `checkout` are both being built, you can run this command to build `decide` (`decide` consumes `explore` and `checkout`, they are both built at this point ): 

```sh 
WITH_ZE=true pnpm --filter tractor_v2_decide run build
```

5. Build `app` 

All the remotes are being built now and Zephyr will be able to map your remote application in output bundle, you can build `app` directly by running: 

```sh 
WITH_ZE=true pnpm --filter tractor_v2_app run build
```



### Deploy to Zephyr Cloud

You can deploy to Zephyr Cloud building the packages:

```sh
WITH_ZE=true pnpm build
```
Or deploy to cloud on each save by running: 
```sh
WITH_ZE=true pnpm serve
```

##### We have now deployed everything! You can open our [Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/zephyr-mission-control/liflhldchhinbaeplljlplhnbkdidedn), 

Select this application on  Chrome Extension, toggle on `Live reload` to inspect file changes while running `WITH_ZE=true pnpm serve`
