# mf-runtime

## How to run this example
First install all by running

```sh
pnpm install && pnpm run install-all
```

After installation run: 
`pnpm run start`

Rspack remotes:
run `host` (localhost:3000) and `app2`

runtime remotes:
run `runhost` (localhost:3003) and `app2`

HMR should work fine in both cases!
